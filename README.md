# Mushrooms selection
In order to find which mushrooms are safe to eat, the Decision Tree classification method is used. The dataset was first cleaned, exploratory data analysis was performed, the tree was built on the training dataset, optimization was applied, and finally the validation of the classification model results was achieved on the test set.

Code: [Decision Tree - Mushrooms Selection Code](https://github.com/AncaPitigoi/mushrooms-selection/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20-%20Mushroom.R)

Skills: data cleaning, data visualization, classification, decision tree

Results: The most important features to look for when mushroom foraging are odor, spore print color, gill size, population, and habitat. The model is exceptional, but achieving perfect classification accuracy and precision is not common in practice, especially in real-world datasets with inherent complexities and noise.
